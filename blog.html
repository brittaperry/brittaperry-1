I hate to be that bitch, but this post does involve my trip to Italy. I said that I hadn't “found” myself and that I didn't feel like a changed person, but now I'm realizing how much it influenced my style.

Last summer, I discovered the amazing material that is linen when I saw everyone in Italy wearing it. People weren't constantly wiping away sweat or rolling up their sleeves. They appeared breezy, cool and carefree, and I craved membership to that club. I looked all over for my own linen articles, but couldn't find anything until I was in Florence, where I bought a pair of bright yellow linen pants for 20 euros. 

I don't know how it works, but linen supposedly keeps you warm in the winter and cool in the summer. It also absorbs moisture easily and becomes softer as you wear it, so wrinkles aren't as apparent over time.

<p></p>Now, I find myself gravitating towards them whenever I need a pop of color, a pick-me-up or am feeling particularly extra. They're so versatile I chose them as the first thing I wanted to blog about because I found so many selfies where I was wearing them.

I haven't been able to find another pair I love as much as the one I currently own, but if I were to get another pair, I would probably get them from Old Navy or Etsy (another option here).

ANYWAYS! Here are a few ways I've been styling LINEN PANTS.

<p>1. When you have physiology at 2 but a Glossier event at 7

<p>This was the outfit I wore to class and then stayed in for Glossier's outdoor movie.

Linen pants are perfect for an event like this because you don't want to be cold when the movie starts playing and it gets chilly at night, and you want to be comfortable but not in sweatpants because you want to impress your fellow Glossier cult members.

I don't really have a name for what I'd call this look, which speaks to how casual you can be in them.

<p>If I had to create a formula for this, it'd be linen pants + box-cut shirt in similar color.

2. Kindergarten art teacher

I call this the kindergarten art teacher look because it's fun so kids know you're creative but not too fun because you're a serious creative. The cuffed pant leg also seems like practical decision that a teacher would make.

<p>I feel like any short-sleeved, patterned button-up shirt will work because they're floral tourist shirt-adjacent which suggests SUMMER VIBES.

Bonus points if you have a necklace, because they always look good under button-up shirt collar.

 

<p>3. Not very discrete private investigator

When my outfit includes these pants, they're typically the item I start with. I had installed a Billy bookcase recently, so Ikea was on my mind and the second thing I reached for was a royal blue linen button-up.

The linen shirt + pant combo feels very put together but relaxed. My shirt is from Uniqlo, but Everlane is also selling them in different styles and colors as well.

It also kind of reminded me of this outfit I saw on Pinterest. With a looser top and the pants untucked, you become a pottery teacher.

How are you styling linen pants? Is this post totally useless because you have them in navy and it's a different story? Do you know of a good place selling linen pants? TELL ME EVERYTHING.
