            Hello! I'm Winnie. I am a 4th year student at University of Toronto for neuroscience and cinema studies, interested in the intersection between psychology and film. Outside of school, I am an aspiring UX designer. All photos are shot on film unless indicated otherwise. I use a Canon AE-1 and Nikon FE2.
